The paircoil program is described in:

Bonnie Berger, David B. Wilson, Ethan Wolf, Theodore Tonchev, 
	Mari Milla, and Peter S. Kim, "Predicting Coiled Coils by Use 
	of Pairwise Residue Correlations", Proceedings of the National 
	Academy of Science USA, vol 92, aug 1995, pp. 8259-8263.



The paircoil program predicts the location of coiled-coil regions in 
amino acid sequences.   Current versions are available for SUN, SGI,  
DEC_alpha and DEC_mips compatable machines.  A version for the Macintosh 
is in production, but is not available yet.

This document contains information on obtaining and installing a copy
of the paircoil program on your system.
Please read the file "Instruction.doc" that accompanies the program 
before running paircoil.



When using the paircoil program in your research, please cite the paper
listed above.   


If you obtain the paircoil program without having sent mail to 
paircoil@theory.lcs.mit.edu, please do so in order to be placed on 
a mailing list for notification of future paircoil modifications.

For further correspondence please email paircoil-help@theory.lcs.mit.edu

                       GETTING THE PROGRAM

To install a copy of the paircoil program you must first obtain a copy
of the file "PAIRCOIL.tar" in your home directory.  You should then 
follow the rest of the instructions in this document (Install.doc).
There are two ways to obtain PAIRCOIL.tar:

	1.  Through the worldwide web at address:
	    http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~bab/paircoil.html

	    Follow the instructions at that site for downloading 
	    the file.

	2.  Via anonymous ftp from:
		address:  theory.lcs.mit.edu
	        directories:  /pub/paircoil/SUN   or   
	                      /pub/paircoil/SGI   or
                              /pub/paircoil/DEC_mips
	        	      /pub/paircoil/DEC_alpha
	          depending on your machine type.
	    (For those of you unfamilar with ftp, an example of what 
	     to do is given at the end of this document).

	IMPORTANT:  Make sure you take the PAIRCOIL.tar that is 
	            compatable with your system type (SUN, SGI, 
	            DEC_alpha, or DEC_mips).
	            The program will not work if it is not designed 
                    for your machine.


Once you have a copy of PAIRCOIL.tar in your home directory, type the 
command:
	"tar -xvf PAIRCOIL.tar"

This command creates a directory ~/PAIRCOIL containing the 
following files:

0.  The documents:   Install.doc and Instruction.doc
1.  The program:     paircoil
2.  The file:        paircoil_config
3.  The data files:
	             cctb.Z, genbnk.Z, and likelihoods 
5.  A version of the pir sequence data base:  
	             sampled-pir.seq.Z
6.  The example sequence file:   test.seq



*******************************************************************************

Before running the program make sure you read the documentation in 
"Instruction.doc".

You should also have a look at the file "paircoil_config".
This file contains information that the program requires,
including where your output files will be written.  Detailed 
information on the contents of "paircoil_config" and how you
may want to modify its contents to control the program is 
available in "Instruction.doc".   If you make modifications,
make sure that the locations of files listed in "paircoil_config"
are correct. 

NOTE that the paircoil program MUST be able to locate the 
"paircoil_config" file in order to run.
By default it looks for "~/PAIRCOIL/paircoil_config".

You can also move the "paircoil_config" file to any location
(for example, if you want to have multiple copies of 
"paircoil_config",  each specifying different ouput files and 
options for running the program).  
However, you must then set the environment variable PAIRCOIL_CONFIG 
to give the file's location.
    
   For example: 
      If you move the paircoil_config file into:
	   "~/paircoil_config"
      then before running the program you would type:
	   "setenv PAIRCOIL_CONFIG ~/paircoil_config".

      You can also put this setenv command in your .login file, so 
      that you do not have to set it each time you logon.




In any case, read the "Instruction.doc" file, and then you are ready to 
run your copy of paircoil. 



After reading "Instruction.doc", you can type:
	"cd ~/PAIRCOIL"
	"paircoil test.seq"
for a test run of the paircoil program.
The output files:
	"~/PAIRCOIL/test.log" and "~/PAIRCOIL/test.ps"
will be created.


	   
*******************************************************************************



EXAMPLE of how to retrieve the files via anonymous ftp:
	(This example is for a SUN user.  Substitute SGI, DEC_alpha,
	 or DEC_mips for SUN in what follows if that is your machine 
         type).

1.  Log on to your own machine.  Make sure you are in the HOME directory
    by typing "cd".

2.  Type "ftp theory.lcs.mit.edu" and log on as "anonymous".

3.  Type "cd /pub/paircoil/SUN". 
	 (replace SUN with SGI or DEC if you need the SGI or DEC versions)

4.  Type the following commands:
          "binary"
	  "get PAIRCOIL.tar"
    Then exit ftp by typing "quit".

5.  Continue with the instruction given earlier in this document.
