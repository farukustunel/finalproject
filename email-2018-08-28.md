Good morning

I'm Dr. Andres Aravena, assistant professor at Istanbul University's Molecular Biology and Genetics Dept. I'm advising a student in a project to identify coiled-coil proteins in *Schizosaccaromyces pombe*. For that we want to use `paircoil2` and `multicoil2`, but we have failed so far.

In the first case, we couldn't run `paircoil2` because we do not have any example of `.paircoil_config` file, neither we found any indication on the proper format. We tried using the configuration file from the old `paircoil` program, but the program failed dumping core. Since we do not have access to the source code, we cannot debug this issue.

We had better results with `multicoil2`. We can run it and get the output files, but we are unable to understand them. The paper is very clear on the training of your model, but we have been unable to see how should we translate the model's output to a useful result. We believe that we would understand better if we can compare the outputs of `paircoil2` and `multicoil2`. Can you advise us on how to understand the output of `multicoil2`?

I guess that probably the details of these programs have been lost in time. It has happened to me several times. On the other side, I can usually understand the inner working of programs by looking at their source code. Do you have any plans to release your code as open source? If that is not the case, can you point us in the direction of the relevant documentation?

Thank you very much for your time and help. Best regards
